# Barista

## Wake-on-demand fork

This fork adds [persistent radio standby](docs/standby.md) and an optional
[on-demand browser dashboard](examples/on-demand/README.md). The browser starts
when a paired GamePad connects and stops after it disconnects. Physical wake,
display, and touch acceptance for this setup are still pending.

The package installation instructions below install upstream Barista. Build
from this fork or follow the example to use these changes.

Use a Wii U GamePad as a wireless second screen, controller, and audio device
for your Linux desktop. Barista handles pairing and streaming, with a desktop
app for managing your GamePads and connections.

Barista is experimental software and is not affiliated with Nintendo.

## Features

- Pair a real Wii U GamePad and reconnect using saved credentials.
- Stream video and audio from compatible applications, with GamePad input.
- Use the GamePad as a controller through Linux `uinput`.
- Integrate other applications through [AppHook](docs/api/README.md).

## Requirements

Real GamePad connections require **Linux and a compatible 5 GHz Wi-Fi adapter**.
Barista temporarily takes over the selected adapter, so use Ethernet or a
second adapter if you also need Internet access.

See [Wi-Fi compatibility](docs/hardware.md) for tested adapters and driver
limitations. Windows and macOS currently support the portable UI/core only.

## Getting started

Signed repositories support Ubuntu 24.04, Fedora 44, Arch Linux, and compatible
derivatives such as CachyOS on x86_64. Choose one update channel:

Stable (recommended after the first Preview build is promoted):

```sh
curl -fsSL https://betazay.github.io/Barista/install.sh | sudo sh -s -- stable
```

Preview (available now):

```sh
curl -fsSL https://betazay.github.io/Barista/install.sh | sudo sh -s -- preview
```

The installer detects the supported distribution, verifies Barista's signing
key, and configures APT, DNF, or Pacman. Afterward, updates arrive through the
normal system updater. See [Package updates and release channels](docs/updates.md)
for manual setup and security details.

To build Barista yourself instead, follow the [compiling guide](COMPILING.md).

After installation:

1. Open Barista as your normal desktop user—never with `sudo` or `pkexec`.
2. Select your Wi-Fi adapter and confirm your country in **Settings → General**.
3. Open **GamePads → Pair a GamePad** and follow the instructions.
4. For a saved GamePad, use **Connect GamePad** on Home.

See the [user guide](docs/user-guide.md) for pairing, play modes, and running
compatible applications. If something fails, open **Settings → Support** and
check the [troubleshooting guide](docs/troubleshooting.md).

## Compatible projects

Experimental integrations are available in these forks; they are not features
of or endorsements by the upstream projects:

- [Cemu](https://github.com/BetaZay/Cemu), branch `barista-connector-prototype`
- [Azahar](https://github.com/BetaZay/Azahar)

## Project status

Pairing, basic video/audio streaming, controller input, and AppHook have been
tested with real hardware. Video can still show artifacts or fall behind;
audio can stutter, and recovery needs improvement. Touch and motion need
broader testing. Camera, microphone, and NFC support are not implemented.
